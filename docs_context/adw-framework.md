# AI Developer Workflow Framework

The complete framework for building AI Developer Workflows (ADWs) - the highest leverage point of agentic coding.

## The Core Insight

> "Raw agents are unreliable. Raw code is inflexible. Combined, they're unstoppable."

ADWs represent the fusion of deterministic orchestration with non-deterministic AI execution. This combination produces reliable, autonomous engineering workflows.

## Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deterministic** | Predictable output, same input = same output | Orchestration code, file paths, branch names |
| **Non-Deterministic** | Creative, adaptive, variable output | Planning, implementing, reviewing |

### The Fusion Pattern

```text
Deterministic Code                 Non-Deterministic Agent
─────────────────                  ───────────────────────
• Orchestrates workflow            • Generates plans
• Controls execution order         • Writes implementation
• Manages file I/O                 • Makes decisions
• Handles errors                   • Adapts to context
• Tracks state                     • Produces creative output
         │                                   │
         └─────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                       │
                  ADW Fusion
               (Reliable Autonomy)
```

## Agentic Layer Classification System

The complete roadmap for building toward the Codebase Singularity.

### Class 1: Foundation (In-Loop Agentic Coding)

Building blocks for interactive agentic development.

| Grade | Component | Key Feature | Load Condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prime Prompts & Memory Files | Thinnest agentic layer | CLAUDE.md, basic prompts |
| 2 | Sub-Agents, Plans & AI Docs | Parallelization | Task agents, spec files |
| 3 | Skills, MCPs & Custom Tools | Extended capabilities | Skill files, MCP servers |
| 4 | Closed-Loop Prompts | Self-correcting agents | Validation loops |
| 5 | Bug/Feature/Chore Templates | Templated engineering | Issue classification |
| 6 | Prompt Chains & Agentic Workflows | Composite workflows | Multi-step prompts |
| 7 | Agent Experts with Mental Models | Self-improving agents | Expertise files |

### Class 2: External Integration (Out-Loop Agentic Coding)

Autonomous workflows triggered externally.

| Grade | Component | Key Feature | Load Condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Webhooks & Out-Loop Systems | External triggers | PITER framework |
| 2 | AI Developer Workflows | Deterministic + non-deterministic | ADW orchestration |

### Class 3: Production Orchestration (Orchestrated Agentic Coding)

Enterprise-grade multi-agent coordination.

| Grade | Component | Key Feature | Load Condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Orchestrator Agent | Meta-agent management | O-Agent pattern |
| 2 | Orchestrator Developer Workflows | Human-orchestrator communication | Hybrid control |
| 3 | ADWs with Orchestrator | Full autonomy with observability | Production deployment |

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Identify your current agentic maturity level:

**Class 1 Assessment:**

- [ ] Grade 1: Do you have CLAUDE.md and basic memory files?
- [ ] Grade 2: Do you use sub-agents and planning templates?
- [ ] Grade 3: Do you have custom skills and MCP integrations?
- [ ] Grade 4: Do prompts self-validate and correct?
- [ ] Grade 5: Do you classify issues with templates?
- [ ] Grade 6: Do prompts chain and compose?
- [ ] Grade 7: Do agents maintain expertise files?

**Class 2 Assessment:**

- [ ] Grade 1: Can webhooks trigger agent workflows?
- [ ] Grade 2: Do you have autonomous ADW execution?

**Class 3 Assessment:**

- [ ] Grade 1: Is there an orchestrator managing agents?
- [ ] Grade 2: Can humans interact with orchestrator?
- [ ] Grade 3: Does orchestrator run full ADWs autonomously?

## ADW Workflow Types

Progressive workflow compositions:

| Workflow | Steps | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan_build` | Plan → Build | Quick implementation |
| `plan_build_review` | Plan → Build → Review | Quality-focused |
| `plan_build_review_fix` | Plan → Build → Review → Fix | Full automation |

## Integration with Orchestrator

```text
Human → Orchestrator → Creates command agents
                    → Commands agents with prompts
                    → Monitors via observability
                    → Aggregates results
                    → Reports to human
```

The orchestrator doesn't do direct work - it delegates, monitors, and coordinates.

## Build Priority

Recommended order for building your agentic layer:

| Priority | Component | Why First |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Memory Files | Foundation for everything |
| 2 | Sub-Agents | Enable parallelization |
| 3 | Skills/MCPs | Extend capabilities |
| 4 | Closed-Loops | Enable self-correction |
| 5 | Templates | Standardize workflows |
| 6 | Agent Experts | Enable learning |
| 7 | ADWs | Enable autonomy |
| 8 | Orchestrator | Enable coordination |

## The Codebase Singularity

The ultimate goal: the point where agents can run your codebase better than you can.

**Prerequisites:**

- Class 3 Grade 3 agentic layer
- AI Developer Workflows for autonomous execution
- Agent Experts for domain knowledge
- Full observability and earned trust
- Zero-touch engineering as the norm

**Indicators:**

- 90%+ of development happens through agents
- Human developers focus on strategy and validation
- The agentic layer continuously improves itself
- Development velocity increases exponentially
